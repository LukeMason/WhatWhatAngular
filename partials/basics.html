<h1>How to speak Angular</h1>

<h3> Controllers and Scope </h3>
<p> Controllers are simply JS functions bound to a particular Scope. They are used to house the logic of your views. Basically these are the glue that bind the Model (data) and View </p>
<h4>Scope</h4>
<p>
Scope is nothing but an object that Glues the View with Controller. They hold all Model data that we need to pass to view. Scope uses Angularâ€™s two-way data binding to bind model data to view. </p><p>
Imaging $scope as an object that links Controller to the View. It is the controller's responsibility to initialize the data that each view needs to display.</p>
<pre ng-non-bindable>
<h5>JavaScript</h5>
/*
NOTE: Although Angular allows you to create Controller functions in the global scope, this is not recommended. In a real application you should use the .controller method
*/

angular.module('myApp.controllers', []).
  controller('HeaderController', ['$scope','$location', 
    function($scope,$location) {

     //A simple function that updates our underlying model with the view location. 
     $scope.isActive = function (viewLocation) { 
        return viewLocation === $location.path();
    }; 

  }])
  .controller('secondController', [function() {
    //Note that these are chain-able, just add all of your controllers this way.
  }]);
</pre>
<h4> Ng-Controller </h4>
<p>
  This attribute defines a Controller to be bound with the view. In this case we defined a controller called HeaderController on the navbar DIV using an ng-controller attribute. Thus whatever we put inside that DIV, will have access to the HeaderController scope. 
</p>
<pre ng-non-bindable>
<h5>HTML</h5>
&lt;div class=&quot;navbar&quot;  ng-controller=&quot;HeaderController&quot; &gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;navbar-header&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a class=&quot;navbar-brand&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;My App&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;ul id=&quot;topNav&quot; class=&quot;nav navbar-nav&quot;&gt;
            &lt;li ng-class=&quot;{ active: isActive('/home')}&quot; &gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#/home&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li ng-class=&quot;{ active: isActive('/view1')}&quot; &gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#/view1&quot;&gt;View 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<h3> Routing </h3>
<p>
Routing helps you in dividing your application in logical views and bind different views to specific Controllers. The magic of Routing is taken care by a service that Angular provides out of the box called $routeProvider.<sup><a href="http://viralpatel.net/blogs/angularjs-routing-and-views-tutorial-with-example/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>  </p>
</p>
<pre ng-non-bindable>
<h5>JavaScript</h5>
angular.module('myApp', []).config(['$routeProvider', function($routeProvider) {
  $routeProvider.when('/basics', {
      templateUrl: 'partials/basics.html', 
      controller: 'MyCtrl1'
  });
  $routeProvider.when('/home', {
      templateUrl: 'partials/home.html', 
      controller: 'HomeCtrl'
  });
  $routeProvider.otherwise({
      redirectTo: '/home'
  });
}]);
</pre>

<h3> Directives </h3>
<p>Directives are my personal favorite feautre of angular, if you've ever wished you could teach your browser new tricks, now you can! At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, or CSS class) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element, or even transform the DOM element and its children.

</p>
<h4>Matching Directives</h4>
<p>Angular normalizes an element's tag and attribute name to determine which elements match which directives. We typically refer to directives by their case-sensitive camelCase normalized name (e.g. ngModel). However, since HTML is case-insensitive, we refer to directives in the DOM by lower-case forms, typically using dash-delimited attributes on DOM elements (e.g. ng-model).<sup><a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p> Here is a simple fiddle that shows how a directive can be used </p>

<h3>Service, Provider, and Factory </h3>
<p>In fact $provide.provider, $provide.factory and $provide.service are 
more or less the same thing in the sense that all of them are 
blueprints / instructions for creating object instances (those 
instances are then ready to be injected into collaborators). 
</p><p>
$provide.provider is the most sophisticated method of registering 
blueprints, it allows you to have a complex creation function and 
configuration options. 
</p><p>
$provide.factory is a simplified version of $provide.provider when you 
don't need to support configuration options but still want to have a 
more sophisticated creation logic. 
</p><p>
$provide.service is for cases where the whole creation logic boils 
down to invoking a constructor function. 
</p><p>
So, depending on the complexity of your construction logic you would 
choose one of $provide.provider, $provide.factory and $provide.service 
but in the end what you are going to get is a new instance.

The angular documentation is quite okay regarding this topic:

<h3> Dependency Injection </h3>
<p>
AngularJS has a built-in dependency injection subsystem that helps the developer by making the application easier to develop, understand, and test. </p>
<p>
Dependency Injection (DI) allows you to ask for your dependencies, rather than having to go look for them or make them yourself. Think of it as a way of saying "Hey I need X", and the DI is responsible for creating and providing it for you. </p>
<p>
To gain access to core AngularJS services, it is simply a matter of adding that service as a parameter; AngularJS will detect that you need that service and provide an instance for you.
</p>
<p> Here is a simple fiddle that shows how DI works. </p>
